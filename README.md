# ROCK-CD
ROCK-CD (ROCK for Community Detection) is an attribute-aware community detection algorithm based on the clustering algorithm ROCK. Basically, the algorithm computes communities by calculating similarity scores between the nodes attributes.
Unlike ROCK, this algorithm does not need the user to agnostically define a number of clusters, because it eventually returns the partition with the highest modularity score.
